	TSPartTime.ascx
	TSPartTime.ascx.vb

1.	#1201:  Error when adding a supervisor to a TS that does not already have a supervisor 
    Added in a .tostring to gracefully convert possible null values to a string value.
2.  #1200   Issue with meal break 
    The mealtime has now been changed to "pass by reference" from "pass by value" and it 
    is updated in the error checking portion of the parttime timesheet control in the 
    function IsValidEntry to be 0. This is then updated like normal. The error message 
    is also suppressed. 
3.  No Case number: Added a web config value to enable toggling of whether parttime 
    employees get an automatic email sent.

        mpDefault.Master
        Controls/TSPartTime.ascx
    SP: usp_GET_EmployeeAnniversary
  
Bugs Fixed

1. (#1180)  Sprint 3: Limit the the budget split to .00 not .000, which 
            is causing an error. 
            this has been fixed by implementing jquery into the app and using 
            the autoNumeric plugin from http://decorplanit.com/plugin/
            

2/23/2010
----------------------------
Files/Tables/Views/Stored Procedures Modified:
    
  File: TSFullTime.ascx.vb
  
Bugs Fixed

1. (#1188)  Error when approving timesheets - Object reference not set to 
            an instance of an object.
            This was due to an extra variable being left in the app that 
            was a result of removing the supervisor vacation pre-approval 
            functionality. This has been fully removed from the app now.



2/18/2010
----------------------------
Files/Tables/Views/Stored Procedures Modified:

    SP: usp_TimesheetAction_ROUTE

	Created SP: usp_SELECT_Timesheet_Overtime
    
  File: clsTimesheet.vb
        TSFullTime.ascx.vb
  
Bugs Fixed

1. (#1135)  Sprint 3: timesheets are automatically processed by TLR if the supervisor 
            submits the timesheet and it has the appropriate amount of hours .
            This has been implemented by adding a parameter to the SP: blnIsDelegate


2/17/2010
----------------------------
Files/Tables/Views/Stored Procedures Modified:
    SP: usp_INSERT_TimesheetAction
  
Bugs Fixed

1. (#1116)  Sprint 3: Timesheet action log had multiple entries for create timesheet

Bugs Fixed

            Removed the code that prints (NP) as well as setting the values
            of the approver view to false for editing those leave values. 
2. (#1092)  Sprint 3: The anniversary date is not showing for employees. 
            Added the anniversary date to the Leave Balance section.

----------------------------
Files/Tables/Views/Stored Procedures Modified:
 Files: Global.asax.vb
 
Bugs Fixed

1. (#1185)  Change https redirect in TLR 
            A fix has been implemented by adding a line in the code that does the 
            http->https redirection. It essentially replaces the '/Default.aspx' 
            with ''.

----------------------------
Files/Tables/Views/Stored Procedures Modified:
 Files: SearchEmployees.aspx

Bugs Fixed

            and exempt employees will be shown 
            Added note back to SearchEmployees.aspx - "Click on an employee to see their 
            Work Schedule, Current Leave Balances, and Timesheets. Note - only 
            classified and exempt employees will be shown." 
2.          Added in a condition so that the export file is not written for test 
            builds, only dev and prod.  
3.  (#1146) Feature for bug was implemented for full-time timesheets, not 
            part-time. This is fixed.

Bugs Fixed

             split to .00 not .000, which is causing an error.

1.  (#1174) Phase2:Part-Time Factulty Employee's with an hourly job is not included in the upload and 
    super can't see TS in employee search.
    Fixed 1/2 of this bug. Now when the supervisor goes into the "search employees" section, 
    the app will show PT faculty who also have hourly jobs. This was done by joining a few 
    tables to grab specifically PT - H faculty.

Files/Tables/Views/Stored Procedures Modified:
	usp_NOTIFICATION_PayrollReminders (see TLR.DB\Change Scripts)
